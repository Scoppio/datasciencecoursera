# Data Science Coursera 
## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The data, with the script is located in the folder UCI HAR Dataset

To run you load week4_project, and set the working directory as the UCI HAR Dataset directory, then finally you call the only function inside it.
create.single.dataframe()

The function will create three csv files, one with the full dataset, one with the mean values and a last one with the standard deviation values.
